# AG Coding Project
This was my first time building a mobile application so I chose Flutter as the framework since it is what the team already uses. The project took me about 8 hours not including setup.

***Note**: I attempted the bonus challenge of allowing users to edit their profile and was partially successful, but was not able to get it to work reliably on all platforms so I moved that work onto its own branch that can be found [here](). Please note uploading new profile photo on this branch is not supported when run as a web app.*
*I ultimately decided to remove this work from the main branch so that I could present an application that could be more easily run and I could fully vet rather than submit unfinished work.*

## Tested platforms:
- Android, Windows, Web

## Steps to run:
1) Setup and install Flutter along with iOS or Android emulator or physical device to run on.
2) Clone or download the code to local environment.
3) Navigate to project root in terminal, run 'flutter pub get', 'flutter clean', and 'flutter run'. Ensure that dependencies are properly loaded without errors.
4) Choose mobile platform, desktop platform, or web browser.

## Demo video:
*TBD*

## Ways I would improve the project given more time:
- More precise font and element styles to match the mockup more closely.
- Automated testing for successfully setting new values in each profile field.
- Input validation and character limits.
