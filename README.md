# AG Coding Project
This was my first time building a mobile application so I chose Flutter as the framework since it is what the team already uses. The project took me about 8 hours not including setup.

***Note**: I attempted the bonus challenge of allowing users to edit their profile picture and was partially successful, but was not able to get it to work 100% reliably in the time I had available to dedicate to this project so I moved that feature onto its own branch which can be found [**here**](https://github.com/plungepool/ag_editprofile/tree/feature/profile-image-picker). I ultimately decided to remove it from the main branch so that I could present an application that could be more easily run and I could fully vet rather than submit unfinished work.*

## Tested platforms:
- Android, Windows, Web

***Note**: Was unable to test on MacOS or iOS as my Macbook is too outdated to run the current version of Flutter.*

## Steps to run:
1) Setup and [install Flutter](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install) along with iOS or Android emulator or physical device to run on.
2) Clone or download the code to local environment.
3) Navigate to project root in terminal, run 'flutter pub get', 'flutter clean', and 'flutter run'. Ensure that dependencies are properly loaded without errors.
4) Choose mobile platform, desktop platform, or web browser.

## Ways I would improve the project given more time:
- Input validation and character limits.
- Automated testing for successfully setting new values in each profile field.
- More precise font and element styles to match the mockup more closely.
- More flexible layout to prevent render overflow errors.
